- DONE ----- >the exit builtin needs some work, check testcases in tester
ALTHOUGH : people removed print exit to stdout for the tester and have put it back for the evaluation and this bad because the comparision with bash gives different cases where exit gets printed and this is confusing

- the export builtin needs some work, check testcases in tester

- shoud be able to execute commands inside /bin even if the PATH is unset

- syntax error: `|` `<` `>` `<<<<` `>>>>>` `|echO|` `<>`

- remove global variable
